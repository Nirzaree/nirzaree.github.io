Hello, my name is Nirzaree. I currently build algorithms for crop type detection at [CropIn Technologies](https://www.cropin.com/), Bangalore, India. I previously built algorithms for navigation and battery health for electric vehicles at [Ather Energy](https://www.atherenergy.com/), and algorithms for bicyclist safety at Lumos Design Technology. My overarching interest is in building technology for sustainability. 

I am currently building participatory platforms aimed towards individual actions for sustainability:
* [Sustainable Eateries](/platforms/) is a crowdsourced database of how sustainable are eateries across the globe
* [Urban Natural Farms](/platforms/) is a platform to enable natural farming in urban vacant land areas to grow food, build communities, and for long term climate resilience. 

I have a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a specialization in Embedded Systems from [TU, Kaiserslautern](https://rptu.de/en/), Germany and an undergraduation in Electronics Engineering from [NIT, Surat](https://www.svnit.ac.in/), India.
